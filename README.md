### Slot Machine Description
A slot machine is a gambling device in which the player must match a set of three symbols to win. In some locales, slot machines are known as "one-armed bandits" because of the handle that is used to pull the lever on traditional slot machines, and the tendency for users to lose all their money playing them.

### Slot Machine Description

The slot machine is rendered on the page using a design powered by CSS Grid and Flexbox. The slot machine features 3 reels, each reel loaded with 9 symbols.

When the page is first loaded, the buttons and reels are not initially active. The live console/info box prompts the user to enter their starting bet, via a prompt.

Once the user enters their starting bet, the slot machine become active, and the player's current balance is displayed. The player can now play the slot machine by clicking the 'SPIN' button. When the 'SPIN' button is pressed, the player's balance is deducted by the bet amount, and the 3 reels will begin to spin for a few seconds, gradually coming to a stop on a random symbol. If all 3 reels have matching symbols, the player's balance is credited in the amount of 10 times their current bet.

The player can cash out and redeem any winnings earned by clicking the 'CASHOUT' button. When the 'CASHOUT' button is pressed, the players balance plus any winnings are redeemed.

The player may continue playing the slot machine until their balance reaches 0. When this happens, a message displays informing the player that they can no longer play the slot machine due to insufficient balance, and to cash out.

For convenience, an 'AUTO PLAY' option has been included for players who want the slot machine reels to automatically spin on their own. Pressing the 'AUTO PLAY' options enables the auto play feature, pressing the 'AUTO PLAY' button once more disables auto play.

### Roadmap and Planned Features
There are several features planned to be implemented to the slot machine in the future, including:

* Incorporating 'wildcard' symbols on the reels to increase the chance of winning
* Incorporating a 'bonus' symbol on the reels to increase the payout of winning
* Implementation of a 'cheat code' feature that enables several hidden functions on the slot machine, including:
    1. Free play by not requiring a bet or not decreasing the user balance on each spin.
    2. Force the reels to match, resulting in jackpot
    3. Freezing one or multiple reels to prevent them from spinning
* Implementation of a cash voucher function which allows users to cash out their winnings in the form of code voucher, which can be entered back into the slot machine as a credit balance for continued play.
* Animating the jackpot message image to make it more aesthetically pleasing
